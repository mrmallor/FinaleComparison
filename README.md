# FinaleComparison
To beat the dead horse. The ending of Game of Thrones was pretty bad...but just how bad relative to other shows. This code uses IMDB's API to access the rankings of a show and compare how worse the last season was compared to others. In the example code provided, GOT season 8 is a whopping 22% worse than 1-7. Breaking Bad is -5% worse. Change the show names and see what degree of D&D your shows finished on!
