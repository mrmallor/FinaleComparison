# FinaleComparison
To beat the dead horse. The ending of Game of Thrones was pretty bad...but just how bad relative to other shows. This code uses IMDB's API to access the rankings of a show and compare how worse the last season was compared to others. In the example code provided, GOT season 8 is a whopping 28% worse than 1-7. Breaking Bad's final season is -5% worse than all of it's prior seasons. Change the show names and see what degree of D&D your shows finished on! 

Note: this will only work on shows that are finished. Otherwise, it will try to analyze episodes that do not yet have ratings.
